Launchers like PrismLauncher can be configured to run commands
before an  instance is launched or after it's closed. Consider putting
`enderchest open /path/to/minecraft_root` in your startup scripts and
`enderchest close /path/to/minecraft_root` in your shutdown scripts (where
"minecraft_root" is the location where you usually run the enderchest commands,
*i.e.* the parent of your EnderChest folder.
