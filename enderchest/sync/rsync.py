    """Run an operation with rsync

    Parameters
    ----------
    working_directory : Path
        The working directory to run the sync command from
    source : str
        The source file or folder to sync, specified as either a URI string,
        an ssh address or a path relative to the working directory
    destination_folder : str
        The destination folder where the file or folder should be synced to,
        with the same formats available as for source
    delete : bool
        Whether part of the syncing should include deleting files at the destination
        that aren't at the source
    dry_run : bool
        Whether to only simulate this sync (report the operations to be performed
        but not actually perform them)
    exclude : list of str
        Any patterns that should be excluded from the sync (and sync)
    *additional_args : str
        Any additional arguments to pass into the rsync command
    timeout : int, optional
        The number of seconds to wait before timing out the sync operation.
        If None is provided, no explicit timeout value will be set.
    verbosity : int
        A modifier for how much info to output either to stdout or the INFO-level
        logs. At...

          - verbosity = -2 : No information will be printed, even on dry runs
          - verbosity = -1 : The sync itself will be silent. Dry runs will only
                             report the sync statistics.
          - verbosity =  0 : Actual syncs will display a progress bar. Dry run
                             reports will summarize the changes to each shulker
                             box in addition to reporting the sync statistics .
          - verbosity =  1 : Actual syncs will report the progress of each file
                             transfer. Dry runs will report on each file to
                             be created, updated or deleted.
          - verbosity =  2 : Dry runs and syncs will print or log the output
                             of rsync run using the `-vv` modifier

        Verbosity values outside of this range will simply be capped / floored
        to [-2, 2].
    rsync_flags : str, optional
        By default, rsync will be run using the flags "shaz" which means:

          - no space splitting
          - use output (file sizes, mostly) human-readable
          - archive mode (see: https://www.baeldung.com/linux/rsync-archive-mode)
          - compress data during transfer

        Advanced users may choose to override these options, but **you do so
        at your own peril**.

    Raises
    ------
    TimeoutError
        If the rsync operation times out before completion
    RuntimeError
        If the rsync operation fails for any other reason

    Notes
    -----
    This method does not perform any validation or normalization of the source,
    destination, exclude-list, additional arguments or rsync options.

      transfer operation (is it a file, a directory or a link? Is it being
